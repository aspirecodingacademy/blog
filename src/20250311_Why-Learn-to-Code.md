## A Decade Since "Hello, World"

It‚Äôs been a decade since I wrote my very first line of code‚Äîprinting `"Hello, World"`. Here are some of the coolest parts of coding that I‚Äôve experienced first hand.

## Digital DIY üî®

Over the years, I‚Äôve built a handful of DIY automation tools. It wasn‚Äôt something I could do in my first year of coding, but as I tinkered over the years, I‚Äôve experienced a unique joy in developing my own solutions to real life problems. For example, the picture on this blog is my own setup program. All programmers know that sometimes configuration and settings are the most tedious bits of getting started on projects. So I was able to fine-tune a script fit to my specific preferences to me automate my setup process on new devices. Not all of my projects are public, but you can check out a few of the open-source ones I‚Äôve released on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dotjasonhwang).

## Mobility and Flexibility ‚úàÔ∏è

With my laptop and an internet connection, I can enter my digital workspace. In fact, sometimes I don‚Äôt even need internet. If I can manage without searching online, I can code anywhere. I‚Äôve coded on flights before (I don‚Äôt anymore, to spare my already subpar posture).

Beyond physical mobility, coding is conceptually flexible. The same problem-solving skills apply to a wide range of domains. For example, I‚Äôve hand-coded minimal websites for events I‚Äôve hosted for friends, using the foundation coding skills I‚Äôve picked up over the years.

## Creativity ‚ú®

The ability to take problems and come up with creative solutions is something I find incredibly rewarding. Few skills offer the same breadth of capability. It‚Äôs corny to say but it‚Äôs true - the sky is the limit.

We should also set expectations here: Though it would be awesome, it is not likely that your local programmer friend can build the next Facebook or Google using that app idea you got in the shower (that‚Äôs why corporations exist). But software is uniquely powerful. Think about it: except for rare cases, the components you need have no physical bounds. You don‚Äôt need to contact manufacturers and figure out shipment of goods. You search for the right components online and you have access, in an instant. The potential to create something new is always within reach.
