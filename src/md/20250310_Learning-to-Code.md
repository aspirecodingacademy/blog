## Exciting Times for Software

Anyone with internet access has unprecedented resources at their fingertips. AI-powered programming is on the rise, and software is evolving faster than ever. How should students starting in 2025 learn to code?

## What Makes a Good Coding Education?

The heart of coding has always been problem-solving. Code is simply instructions for computers, executed through different languages and toolkits. No matter the approach, the goal remains the same: solving problems.

A solid coding curriculum should cover fundamentals while fostering a tenacious problem-solving mindset. In practice, this will look different at various levels, but for beginners, itâ€™s crucial to go beyond tutorials and narrowly focused skill sets. Too many students fall into "tutorial hell," watching endless videos but never progressing. Coding is like a sportâ€”itâ€™s not a skill learned through rote memorization. You need to practice. And you need a good coach. While some have taught themselves, itâ€™s not an efficient path for most.

Here are my thoughts on three practical matters:

### College Degrees ðŸŽ“

Computer Science majors continue to grow in popularityâ€”and for good reason. Quality programs offer a comprehensive education, networking opportunities, and internship preparation. High school coding courses are becoming more common and generally helpful, but university programs are where most students develop into well-rounded programmers.

### Prerequisites ðŸ“‹

Basic arithmetic is essential, and algebra helps unlock deeper understanding. Typing is important, but young students can start coding before mastering proper form. Beyond that, the real learning happens through hands-on practice.

### Is AI Going to Take Away Programming Jobs? ðŸ¤–

While I don't have a crystal ball, I believe we are far from coding becoming an entirely automated field. If anything, the demand for skilled programmers is increasing thanks to advancements in LLM tools.

## A Word of Encouragement

Is coding for everyone? Most people can learn to code, but it requires persistence. Frustration is normalâ€”think of it like sore muscles after a good workout. You wonâ€™t know if coding is for you until you try. I didnâ€™t enjoy coding in high school, but I fell in love with it in college.
